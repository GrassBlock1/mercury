## 🚀 Getting Started
clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://git.gb0.dev/gb/mercury.git
```
```bash
cd mercury && pnpm install
```
run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
open [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser.

## 🔧 Usage
All you need is editing the `astro.config.mjs`'s site & base.

For further config, edit `src/config.ts` according to the comment.

To start writing, put your markdown & mdx files to /src/content/posts folder.

To create a page, put markdown files into /src/content/pages folder.

Shortcode-like components is also available at /src/components/shortcodes folder.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## ⚙️ Advanced Usage
### i18n
I have implemented i18n support for UI text, but not for content translations yet.

To further implement i18n, you can:
1. Create a new folder under `src/content/posts/` with the language code as the name (e.g., `en`, `zh-CN`, etc.).
2. Copy your translated markdown files into the new folder.
3. Copy the `src/pages/blog/` folder to `src/pages/[langcode]/blog`.
4. Update the i18n config in `astro.config.mjs` to include the new language code.
5. Rebuild the site.
### plain text version when visiting the site via `curl`
The text version of the site is generated by `src/pages/blog/[slug].txt.js`, which outputs a plain text version of the blog post.
To access it, you can visit `https://your-site.com/blog/your-post-slug.txt`.

To automatically output the text version when visiting the site via `curl`, you can:
1. If you are using caddy, add the following to your `Caddyfile`:
   ```caddyfile
   @curl {
        header_regexp User-Agent (?i)curl 
   }
   @text {
        path_regexp text /blog/(.*)
   }
   handle @curl {
        rewrite @text /blog/{http.regexp.text.1}.txt
   }
   ```
2. If you are using cloudflare to proxy your site, you can add a page rule to redirect requests with the `curl` user agent to the `.txt` version of the blog post:
   If incoming requests match (Custom filter expression):
   ```
   (http.request.full_uri wildcard r"https://yourblog/blog/*" and http.user_agent contains "curl")
   ```
   Then (Rewrite to,static):
   ```
    /blog/${1}.txt
   ```
3. If you are using other web servers, you can use functions like `rewrite` or `redirect` by user agent (HTTP header) to achieve the same effect.

## 😊 Special Thanks
The terminal theme from [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev) is cool, and it inspired me to create a theme like this.

[Bolt](https://bolt.new) by StackBlitz (anyway I'm not affiliated with them) helps me to create a starter template from screenshot when I don't know where to start, the one now is much different from the template though.

Other tools like GitHub Copilot helps too.

(I know the LLMs sometimes sucks, but it really helps most of the time)

Also, [delucis/astro-blog-full-text-rss](https://github.com/delucis/astro-blog-full-text-rss) for implementing full text RSS in pretty easy way.
